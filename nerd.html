<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This page has some links for more information or things to try out.
Of course there is always Google, or DuckDuckGo.com, for finding even more.

<h2>Robots</h2>
<ul>
<li>
BOE-bot -- (Board of Education robot) from Parallax. This runs BASIC
which is a bit old, but great for learning. The included book teaches
basic electronics and experimentation. $75 on eBay
</li>
<li>
mBot -- Arduino based. This is programmed using C++.
Usually around $200. Has some reliability issues.
</li>
<li>
LEGO -- Drag and drop coding. Very easy to use. Around $300.
</li>
<li>
<p>Open source turtle robot. Instuctions at 
<a href=https://www.instructables.com/id/OSTR/>https://www.instructables.com/id/OSTR</a>.  Parts kit at <a href=https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/open-source-turtle-robot-ostr/>https://www.tindie.com/products/MakersBox/open-source-turtle-robot-ostr/</a>. Easy to build kit. Some soldering is required. This may be hacked to do other things, but that is left to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
Other robot kits, mostly based on Arduino microcontrollers, are available on Amazon.com,
RobotShop.com or similar sites. Google is your friend. Understand what
you are buying. There is a lot of variation.

<h2>Flashy Boards</h2>
<ul>
<li>
CodeBug -- uses blocky drag and drop coding to program a 5x5 matrix of
red LEDs. Allows view of JavaScript
and Python, but does not allow programming in those languages.
Can access external switches (like Makey-Makey).
See <a href=https://codebug.org.uk>codebug.org.uk</a> to try programming before buying.
</li>
<li>
Micro:Bit -- uses blocky drag and drop coding and JavaScript.
Has 5x5 red LED matrix, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, thermometer,
radio (Bluetooth and proprietary). Needs an external battery or USB cable.
In general this is a good bang for the buck.
See <a href=https://microbit.org>microbit.org</a>  to try programming before buying.
</li>
<li>
AdaFruit Circuit Playground -- LEDs arranged in a circle. LEDs are RBG which means they
can be any color under program control.  Uses blocky, JavaScript,
and microPython. Has accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, thermometer.
Need to add external battery.
See <a href=https://makecode.adafruit.com>makecode.adafruit.com</a>
to try programming before buying.
</li>
<li>
Raspberry Pi + Sense Hat -- Program in just about any language. Library has been written
for Python. 8x8 LED matrix uses RGB LEDs.  Has accelerometer, gyroscope,
magnetometer, thermometer, humidity sensor. Need to add external power supply.
Lots of information at
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">http://raspberrypi.org</a>. Free downloads of
issues of MagPi, the official Raspberry Pi magazine at
<a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi">http://raspberrypi.org/magpi</a>.

<h2>Coding</h2>
<p>
The language of your first project isn't important. They all do basically
the same thing. Block drag and drop coding is popular with kids just starting
out because it eliminates typing and syntax errors.
Python is an easy language to use because it is very similar to English, yet
it has enough power to do many business and scientific tasks.
JavaScript is also an easy, but powerful language and is widely available
because it is part of nearly every browser.
C++, is C with extensions for object oriented programming, is a more
technical language, but is popular among Linux enthusiasts.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=https://Code.org>Code.org</a> -- hour of code lessons are a fun quick
introduction. Longer courses are available at all grade levels.
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://CodeCombat.com>CodeCombat.com</a> -- solve programming problems
to advance through adventure game. $
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://class42.com/RobotRattle.html>class42.com/RobotRattle.html</a> --
program robot movements with block drag and drop coding.
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://microbit.org>microbit.org</a> for a tutorial and code reference for
the BBC micro:bit computer.
<a href=https://makecode.microbit.org>https://makecode.microbit.org</a>
can be used without the micro:bit devices to write code in blocky
(drag and drop), JavaScript, or Python.
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://bitsbox.com/go>bitsbox.com/go</a> -- simple JavaScript programming
for standalone apps. This site offers activity cards for things to program.
It can be used without paying with your own ideas. $
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://Tynker.com>Tynker.com</a> -- coding for kids. $
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://turtlegraphics.fun>turtlegraphics.fun</a> for JavaScript-based
turtle graphics. Tutorials and examples also on that site.
</li>
<li>
<a href=https://w3schools.com>w3schools.com</a> Simple courses in various
languages. Lots of examples when you forget how to use something.

<a href=https://TomorrowCorporation.com>TomorrowCorporation.com</a>
Human Resource Machine is a game that teaches the
basics of assembly language programming that is almost as close as you can get
to programming the actual hardware (yes, machine language programming is closer
but too hard to get serious about). This is about as nerdy as it gets. The
game has various levels. On each level you solve a program in what amounts
to be assembly language. It is fun, although meeting the challenges can take
extra time.  Great for kids or adults. $$
