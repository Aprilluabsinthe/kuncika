<h2>IDE User Guide</h2>
<p>
  IDEs or Integrated Development Environments allow a user to write and test
  code on a single page.  This IDE allows a user to write JavaScript code with
  Turtle Graphics functions and see the graphical results. code and test it on
  a single web page. No other program is required. Just a modern browser that
  can support HTML5 like Chrome or Firefox. Some older browsers may not work.

    alt="The JavaScript Turtle Graphics IDE with explanations"
    style="width:100%;">
<p>
The IDE screen is divided into four main areas:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#Reference"><strong>Language Reference</strong></a> is a guide
    to the Turtle Graphic functions that may be used to draw graphics on the
    canvas. Underlined examples may be clicked upon to see there immediate
    effect on the turtle and the canvas.
  </li>
  <li><a href="#Canvas"><strong>Canvas</strong></a> is the area where the
    graphics are drawn.  The drawing is done by the turtle which
    is modeled as a triangle pointing in the direction of travel.
    Imagine that the turtle has a pen in its belly and that the pen
    leaves a mark as the turtle moves.
  </li>
  <li><a href="#Command"><strong>Command</strong></a> is an area with
    controls for entering simple JavaScript commands or to control
    the examples.  There also are a
    set of buttons that are used to reset the canvas and to control the
    execution of the example code.
  </li>
  <li><a href="#Code"><strong>Code</strong></a> is an area for
    loading, displaying, and editing JavaScript Turtle Graphic helper
    functions or whole programs.
    There are several examples which you can load with the example
    selector above the code area.
    Modified code can be downloaded to you computer and saved programs
    can be loaded as well with buttons at the bottom of the code area.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
  Each of these areas is explained in more detail below.
</p>
<h2><a id="Reference"></a>Language Reference</h2>
<p>
The language reference lists the available functions for Turtle Graphics.
</p>
<p>
  Parameters are <em>italicized</em> and enclosed within parentheses '('
  and ')' characters.  Optional parameters and separating commas are
  enclosed within square bracket '[' and ']' characters.
  The square brackets are not used when invoking the function, but the
  separating commas must be supplied.  So for the function template
  <code>foo(<em>a</em> [,<em>b</em> [,<em>c</em>]])</code>, one can invoke 
  function foo() as <code>foo(1)</code>, <code>foo(1,2)</code> or <code>foo(1,2,3)</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Alternative forms of the functions are separated with the pipe '|'
  character.  These forms provide some compatibility with other versions
  of Turtle Graphics.  Each of the alternate forms is identical in function.
</p>
<p>
  Examples are shown in <code>bold typewriter font</code>. Each example may
  be clicked to immediately execute it to see what it does.  This allows
  the reader to directly experiment with the function.  The user may edit
  the parameters in the command box to see their effect.
</p>
<p>
  This platform uses JavaScript and its syntax.  While many programs can be
  written with the Logo Graphics functions alone, it is possible (and
  sometime necessary or desirable) to use the full power of the JavaScript
  language.  For a brief tutorial on JavaScript please
  <a href="javascript.html">see separate page.</a>
</p>

<h2><a id="Canvas"></a>Canvas</h2>
<p>
  The canvas is the area where the graphics are drawn. When the platform is
  started up or reset, the turtle is moved to the center of the canvas.
  The turtle is represented as a triangle pointing in the direction that the
  turtle will move if issued a <code>forward()</code> command.
</p>

<p>
  The canvas is described with a coordinate system, which is like graph
  paper where the lines are numbers.  The center is (0,0) or an X-coordinate
  of zero and a Y-coordinate of 0.  Positive X-coordinates increase to the
  right of center. Negative X-coordinates increase to the left of center.
  Positive Y-coordinates increase from the center toward the top of the canvas.
  Negative Y-coordinates increase from the center toward the bottom of the
  canvas.  This mimics the Cartesian coordinate system used in algebra and
  other mathematics.  Note that this coordinate system is different than the
  normal JavaScript canvas coordinate system (origin at the top left and only
  positive coordinates).  The Turtle Graphics functions hide these differences
  and much of the mathematical complexity from the user.
</p>
<p>
  Above the canvas is an <strong>Information</strong> or <strong>i</strong>
  button which may be pressed to control the pop-up information which appears
  when hoovering the mouse over a button or area of the IDE. When it is blue,
  the pop-up help information is active. When it is red, the pop-up help
  information is in-active.
</p>
<p>
  Also above the canvas is an <strong>Home</strong> button which may be
  pressed to return to the Turtle Graphic home page.
</p>

<h2><a id="Command"></a>Command Area</h2>
<p>
  The command area has a text box for entering a simple JavaScript code
  statement to execute or to control execution of code in the code area.
  A JavaScript statement including Logo Turtle Graphic functions may be
  entered into the Command box.  Normally this is used to execute the
  code in the code area, which is invoked with the <code>demo()</code>
  function.  You can invoke Turtle Graphics functions, like
  <code>forward(10)</code> to see how they work. Indeed most of the
  functions described in the Language reference page do just that.  When
  <span class="keyboard">ENTER</span> or <span class="keyboard">RETURN</span> key is
  pressed, the statement is executed. Successful
  graphic functions are immediately displayed on the canvas.  Syntax errors
  (e.g., missing parentheses, unknown function name, unexpected end of program)
  and other errors are also shown on the canvas.
</p>
<p>
  The <span class="button">RESET</span> button can be used to clear the
  canvas, move the turtle to the center of the canvas, and initialize the IDE.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes the IDE can get locked up and it is necessary to reload the web
  page with the page reload function of the browser.  This can happen if you
  mistakenly assign a function name to a value. The function will no longer
  work as it is now a variable with a value.  For example, you have executed
  the code <code>forward() = 10</code> and then try to execute
  <code>forward(10)</code> you will get the error <strong>Forward is not a
  function.</strong>. Reload the page with the browser (click on the
  browser reload button) and all will be well.
</p>
<p>
  The IDE may also need to be reloaded if the program gets stuck in an
  infinite loop.
</p>

<p>
  The <span class="button">RUN DEMO</span> button can be used to run code
  in the Code box provided that the code includes a demo() function.
  Syntax errors in the program may not be apparent. Some errors may be
  visible on the canvas by invoking <code>demo()</code> from the command
  text box.
</p>

<p>
  The <span class="button">CLEAR</span> button can be used to clear the
  code in the example area.
</p>
<p>
  When the example code executes either <code>animate()</code> or
  <code>delay()</code> functions, a <span class="button">STOP</span>
  button will appear allowing the user to stop the animation in progress
  without clearing the canvas. The <span class="button">RESET</span> button will
  also stop the animation, but it clears the canvas.
</p>
<p>
  Any code in the <strong>Code area</strong> is evaluated when the
  <span class="keyboard">ENTER</span> or <span class="keyboard">RETURN</span> key is
  press with the cursor within the Command box. So the last line of the
  example code could invoke any of its functions, (e.g., <code>demo();</code>)
  which could in turn be executed when an <span class="keyboard">ENTER</span> or <span class="keyboard">RETURN</span> key is pressed with a cursor in an empty Command box.
</p>

<h2><a id="Code"></a>Code Area</h2>
<p>
  The example is an area for loading, displaying, and editing JavaScript Turtle
  Graphic programs. Several examples are available in the select menu above
  the  box. Selecting an example causes the example to be loaded, but not
  executed. The user must press the <span class="button">RUN DEMO</span> button to
  execute the example code.
</p>

<p>
  The user may edit the example code to make modifications or to try out
  new code. Changes will survive reloading of the page, but will not be
  saved in general. To save the modified code, select all of the code, paste
  it into your favorite text editor, and save it. To load the saved code,
  use the text editor to access the code, select all of the text, and then
  paste the text into the <strong>Code area</strong>. JavaScript, in general,
  does not access files on your local machine for security reasons.
</p>
<h2><a id="Limitations"></a>Limitations</h2>
<p>
  Not all errors are caught.  If the error is not apparent, more details
  are usually available on the on the JavaScript console which is accessed
  through the developer tools of the browser being used. This can be accessed
  by pressing control- or command-shift-C or by finding "Developer Tools" or
  "Web Developer" in the browser menus and selecting the "Console" or "Web
  Console" functions.  The JavaScript
  console is a very powerful tool that allows you to inspect various elements
  of a web page and see their attributes, check performance, single step through
  JavaScript code and other functions, we are only interested in the console
  at this point. The rest of the console functions are worth exploring as you
  become more familiar with web programming.
</p>
<p>
  The Logo language is not implemented here, nor is its syntax. This
  is only a set of JavaScript functions that mimic the Logo Turtle Graphics
  part of the Logo language.
</p>
<h2><a id="Standalone"></a>Stand Alone Mode</h2>
  The IDE can be used without a connection to the internet in what is called
  a stand alone mode.  Download or clone the files from
  <a href="https://github.com/kirkcarlson/js-tur">https://github.com/kirkcarlson/js-tur</a>
  into a dedicated directory.  Access
  the files with your browser by opening the <strong>index.html</strong> file
  in that directory.
