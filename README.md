This repository holds the files for the [https://performance.github.io/kuncika/ ] (URL) web site.

With Trutlegraphics in a few Indian Languages + Korean as a quick demo. 

 This is a quick and dirty hach, so inherits everythiung else from the upstream project.

Turtle Graphics code, but the documentation and lessons as well. You can visit the live site at
[https://TurtleGraphics.fun](URL) for more information about Turtle Graphics itself.
