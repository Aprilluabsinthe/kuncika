<h2>About Turtle Graphics</h2>
  <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Turtle graphics were originally developed as part of the Logo language
      developed
      in 1967 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), a Cambridge,
      Massachusetts research firm, by Wally Feurzeig and Seymour Papert.
      There have been several attempts to commercialize
      turtle graphics for small children including the Terrapin Turtle and Apple
      Logo Graphics using an Apple ][ computer. Most implementations
      of Turtle Graphics did not include a full implementation of the Logo language.

  <h3>History of This Page</h3>
    <p>
      This project was forked from https://github.com/bjpop/js-turtle. This
      project had the basic turtle
      functions, the <strong>animate</strong> function, the immediate execution 
      of the <strong>**command**</strong>
      line, and the editable <strong>**definitions**</strong> area. This was 
      the substantial portion of
      this project, and overall had brilliant ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kirk Carlson added some turtle functions and added enhancements to make
      the project more of a code developent platform. It is hoped that this
      project can help young programmers move from code.org and Scratch projects
      to JavaScript projects.
