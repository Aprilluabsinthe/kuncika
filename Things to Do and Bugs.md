#Things To Do
The following are features that should be implemented:

* A button to clear the defintions pane
* make it more obvious that the definitions pane can be modified
* A better way to control positioning of the three panels
* Fix to the Run button
* A way to fill a closed polygon
* Better integration of an instructional pane
	* It should have a lesson: some instruction and some things to do
	* It should have a ghost outline of something to draw
	* It should make sure that the student has accomplised the task.
* should have load and save capability to encourage program development
* maybe record things clicked on the language reference to build programs more easily
* do you need lint? would that be easy to add?
* do you need syntax highlighting? or at least discuss it.
* include the intersection simulator as an example of using the turtle.js as a library on a standalone page.

#Bugs
* help text is flashed on screen during load
* make the run button better
	* if demo() is undefined, just say "Run"
	* make enter work all of the time on the command line
* needs some protection from infinite loops

 
#Needed Examples
* simple traffic light simulator
* integrate intersection simulator
* more fractal examples
* asymmetric tree
* more tessellation examples
	* pentagons
	* herring bone
* star evolution
	* basic 5-pointed star
	* open up points
	* move star (dx, dy)
	* grow star (dSize)
	* spin star (dAngle)
	* move and grow and spin star
	* array of stars
