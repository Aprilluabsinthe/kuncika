#Things To Do
The following are features that should be implemented:

* make the definitions pane stand out more by moving the examples select to the bottom of that pane
* make it more obvious that the definitions pane can be modified
* A better way to control positioning of the three panels, like some sort of sliding division
* Get more error message to show up
* Fix the Run button, so that it executes the command line also.
* A way to fill a closed polygon
	* this may be a mode that turns off the incremental drawing: fillStart, fillEnd
	* such a feature may be great for drawing the fractals also
* Better integration of an instructional pane
	* It should have a lesson: some instruction and some things to do
	* It should have a ghost outline of something to draw
	* It should make sure that the student has accomplised the task.
	* This really duplicates what is done on the Kahn code academy... is this what you want to do??
* should have load and save capability to encourage program development
* maybe record things clicked on the language reference to build programs more easily
* do you need lint? would that be easy to add?
* do you need syntax highlighting? or at least discuss it.
* include the intersection simulator as an example of using the turtle.js as a library on a standalone page.
* figure out how to load examples on the fly.
* figure out a way to display examples hierarchically

#Bugs
* make the run button better
	* if demo() is undefined, just say "Run"
	* make enter work all of the time on the command line
	* demo() needs to be cleared when changing examples (e.g., flag to clock, binary)
	* demo() may be should be called automatically when the example is loaded
* add a visible version number to this thing somewhere
* need some protection from infinite loops (hard to do without injecting code somewhere)mo
* arc and curve test is missing third example
	* Should add example for rounded rectangles
* hexagon tesselation is not working
* circle eye could be bigger, maybe different colors for each inscribed circle
* color changing dots is not working, should start with a clear
* dividing a circle is not working *****Fixed without identifying problem**
* Add tag //*sourceURL=foo.js to bottom of all examples for debugging purposes (or just add ~=definitions.js via the exec command?) <--alternate is better because it works for user entered code
* optionally
