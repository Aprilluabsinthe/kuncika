<h2> Tesselations </h2>
<p>
A tesselation is a mathematicians way of laying geometrically shaped tiles to
completely cover a surface.
Square tessellations are the simplest followed closely by rectangles, triangles
and hexagons.
Regular pentagons, those with equal angles cannot tessellate, but there are 18
pentagon shapes that do tessellate.
Some shapes tessellate, but have unusual patterns that do not repeat
(called non-periodic). Wall paper relys on
periodic patterns, so a non-periodic pattern could not be used for wall paper.

Polyhedra
</h2>
<p>
Polyhedra are three-diminsional geometric objects. These include the five platonic solids: tetrahedron (4 triangle faces), cube (6 square faces), octahedron (8 triangle faces), dodecahedron (12 pentagon faces), and icosahedron (20 triangle faces). More information at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids or at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron. There are various ways to display these in two dimensions including a model, that can be printed, cut out and glued, and a graph which shows all edges, vertices (points), and faces."
