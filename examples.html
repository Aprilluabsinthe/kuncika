  Examples
</h1>
<p>
This page contains examples of the graphics generated with the turtle graphics
program. This is a pictorial index, so clicking on an image will bring up
the Turtle Graphic IDE loaded with the program to generate the image.
The description of the example tells what inspired the example, where more
information can be found, or where similar things can be found.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to use this. One is to explore the possibilities. The
other is to use these as inspirations to do something similar or to even
copy the design. You can use the example code to start from or you can
try to build the design from a blank slate. You will learn more building
your designs from scratch.

At last count there are 85 examples.

<h2> Tessellations </h2>
<p>
A tessellation is a mathematicians way of laying geometrically shaped tiles to
completely cover a surface.
Square tessellations are the simplest followed closely by rectangles, triangles
and hexagons.
Regular pentagons, those with equal angles cannot tessellate, but there are 18
pentagon shapes that do tessellate.
Some shapes tessellate, but have unusual patterns that do not repeat
(called non-periodic). Wall paper relies on
periodic patterns for printing with a cylinder shaped pattern.
A non-periodic pattern could not be practical for wall paper.

Polyhedra
</h2>
<p>
Polyhedra are three-diminsional geometric objects. These include the five
platonic solids: tetrahedron (4 triangle faces), cube (6 square faces),
octahedron (8 triangle faces), dodecahedron (12 pentagon faces), and
icosahedron (20 triangle faces). More information at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solids</a>
or at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron</a>.
There are various ways to display
these in two dimensions including a model, that can be printed, cut out and
glued, and a graph which shows all edges, vertices (points), and faces.

      The game of life was conceived by William Conway as a way to
      study cellular automata, the idea where a simple discision is performed
      by individual cells without regard to the computation of other cells.
      The rules of lif are simple. A living cell that touches 0, 1 or 2 other
      cells dies as if from isolation. A living cell that touches 3 or four
      lives on to another generation. A living cell that touches 5 or 6 dies
      as if from over-crowding. A non-living cell may be given life or born
      if it is touching exactly 3 living cells.

      This puzzle consists of nine wooden blocks. The blocks may slide
      vertically or horizontally when there is space for them to move.
      There is one large block that is 2 units by 2 units, one horizontal block
      that is 2 units wide by 1 unit high, four vertical blocks that are
      1 unit wide and 2 units high, and four small blocks that are 1 unit
      wide and 1 unit high. The objective is to move the large block from
      the top center position to the bottom center position. This puzzle goes
